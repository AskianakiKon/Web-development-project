<h2> Ada Lovelace </h2>

<p> Augusta Ada King (nee Augusta Ada Byron, 10 December 1815-27 November 1852) was an English writer and mathematician widely known for her work in Babbage Analytical Engine. Ada parents were the romantic poet George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron and Anne Isabella Milbanke, 11th Baroness Wentworth. One month after Ada's birth her parents was divorced, and her father left England forever four months later. He died of disease when Ada was 8 years old during the Greek War of Independence. In 1835 she married William King whom in 1838 becoming Earl of Lovelace therefore Ada became Countess of Lovelace. Her interest and education led her into communication with many world known people such as Andrew Crosse, Charles Babbage, Sir David Brewster, Charles Wheatstone, Michael Faraday and the author Charles Dickens. Ada first met Charles Babbage (who is known as "father of computers") in June 1833 through one of her tutors (Mary Somerville) and led her to a long friendship and work communication.</p>

<h3> Childhood </h3> 

<p>Ada was named after her father's half-sister Augusta Leigh and was called Ada by him. When Ada was five weeks old (16 January 1816) Lord Byron instructed Lady Byron to go back at Ada's grandparents with her. Even though English law at that time gave full custody in the father in case of separation Lord Byron did not want to claim his parental rights and asked his sister to keep him informed of Ada's activities.
Ada did not have a good relationship with her mother even though she was the only noteworthy parental figure in Ada's life. She was often left with her maternal grandmother Judith, Hon. Lady Milbanke. However, Lady Byron had to present herself as a loving mother and often wrote anxious letters to Lady Milbanke about her daughter's welfare with notes saying to retreat the letters upon asking, because of the societal attitudes of the time. In one letter to Lady Milbanke, she referred to her daughter as "it": "I talk to it for your satisfaction, not my own, and shall be very glad when you have it under your own." Lady Byron was anxious about her daughter's mental health (because of her father's record) and had her watched by close friends for any signs. </br>
Ada at the age of eight experienced headaches that obscured her vision. She was paralyzed after a fit of measles and was put to bed rest for over a year. She continued her education and developed her mathematical and technological skills despite of the illness. At the age of twelve, Ada decided she wanted to fly. She went about the project methodically, thoughtfully, with imagination and passion. She examined the anatomy of birds to determine the right proportion between the wings and the body. She decided to write a book, Flyology, illustrating, with plates, some of her findings. In her late 20s, she had an affair with a tutor and tried to elope with him, but her mother was contacted. Lady Byron though covered the affair to prevent a public scandal.

<h3> Adult years </h3>

<p> Ada on 8 July 1835 married William, 8th King becoming Lady King. Ada and William had three heirs: Byron (born 12 May 1836), Anne Isabella (called Annabella, born 22 September 1837), and Ralph Gordon (born 2 July 1839). In 1838 King William was made Earl of Lovelace and Viscount Ockham, meaning that Ada became Countess of Lovelace. 
 In 1841 Ada was told by her mother that Medora Leigh (the daughter of Lord Byron's half-sister Augusta Leigh) was also Lord Byron's daughter. In the 1840s there were many scandals about Ada such as rumors for affairs and gambling. She lost more than 3,000£ during the 1840s. Her love of gambling led her to organize a syndicate and an attempt to create a mathematical model for successful large bets. This attempt was never successful and led Ada to a financial obligation costing over thousands of pounds to the syndicate, which forcing her to confess it all to her husband. From 1844 onwards she had a mysterious relationship with Andrew Crosse's son John. Most of their letters were destroyed after her death as part of a legal agreement. She passes on him all her father’s heirlooms. </p>

<h3> Death </h3> 

<p> Ada Lovelace died from uterine cancer at the age of 36 (the same age as her father) on 27 November 1852. While she was sick Annabella took command over the visitors of her mother and forbidden all her friends and confidants. On 30 of August Ada's husband left her side due to something that she said to him that it is not known. At her request, Ada was buried next to her father at the Church of St. Mary Magdalene in Hucknall, Nottinghamshire. A memorial plaque in Latin to her and her father is in the chapel attached to Horsley Towers.
