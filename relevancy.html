<h1>  The technological contribution Ada has made is still relevant today </h1>    

<h2> Ada Lovelace </h2> 

<p> Ada Lovelace lived during the early 19th century and was highly educated even though women at that time did not have the opportunity to further their education level. However, things for women hasn’t changed dramatically over the years, from the 19th century to now.   </br>    For instance, many women ovoid to further their education in science because of the confrontation they will have to tolerate from society. Additionally, women in science need coaching, mentoring, sponsorship and advice. But, nowadays teachers often try to unencouraged women to choose the science path no matter how hard they work to achieve their goals. In conclusion, in our society, women usually do not have the encouragement they need to start getting more interest in science.   </br>   Furthermore, in Ada’s case, she has shown the world that, no matter how difficult the circumstances are, women can succeed in science and help the word improve, as good as men have done in the past. Ada’s success in science could help change the societal attitude against women involved in scientifically work at our century.   </br>   Moreover, Ada’s work in science has helped the technological world to progress and be able to contribute to people’s life. For example, Ada was the first person to anticipate that machines could manipulate numbers and expectedly be used to present any data that was represented by numbers, including that machines could have artificial intelligence (machines could compose music). Although Ada was never able to watch her work become true, she never doubted herself and stayed loyal to her thoughts about science. In the end, it was proved that Ada was right.Her scientific research was the beginning of a new era and the start of our technological evolution. Without her work, our world would have not existed as w eknow it and we would never cooperate with each other the way we do today.   </br>    Ada’s contribution to technology is relevant today because of the improvement of the communication between two people that live in other countries. In the past, people could communicate with each other with handwriting letters or pigeons.That would take up to a few days or even weeks sometimes. Despite the many days anotheR problem was that the communications between people had limited distance. In other words, the people needed to be in a short distance and would take many days to ‘hear’ an answer, sometimes the letters would be lost or the people carried them would get killed. In conclusion, as said before, Ada’s contribution to technology has a major part in technological improvement. </p>

<p> Lovelace died of cancer in 1852, when she was only 36. More than 150 years later, we remember her contributions to science and engineering in the celebration of Ada Lovelace Day (second Tuesday of October). First celebrated in 2009 (in March), it is a day set aside to learn about women in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.</p>
