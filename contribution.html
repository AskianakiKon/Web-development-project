        <h3> First computer program </h3>

        <p> Ada Lovelace is known as the first computer programmer. She lived during the 19th century and she was a woman involved in science which at that time was very difficult.
            However, she wrote the world’s first algorithm for a computing machine that Charles Babbage had designed on paper but never successfully build it due to personal barriers
            and financing difficulty. Although the machine was never built during the 19thcentury, scientists were able to construct it in London in 2002 (153 years after it was designed).
            It is worth noting that Ada Lovelace was just a teenager when she first met Cambridge mathematics professor Charles Babbage.<br> During 1842 Babbage gave a lecture on the
            engine at the University of Turin. A French mathematician transliterated the lecture in French. In her late 20s, Ada was authorized to translate the transcript into English.
            Babbage encouraged his fellow friend ,Ada, to add her notes to the lecture which cause the transcript to increase in length by 3 times. Ada’s notes indicated that she understood
            the Analytical Engine as Babbage himself and moreover she knew how to make the machine calculate Bernoulli numbers, which is considered the first algorithm of history. She also
            understood that the machine that could manipulate numbers could expectedly beused to present any data that was represented by numbers such as compose music, produce graphics
            that would be very useful in science.
